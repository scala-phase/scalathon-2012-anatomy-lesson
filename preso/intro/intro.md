## Agenda

Overview of the technologies we'll be using:

* Setup (_giter8_, _git_, etc.)
* hosting (GitHub)
* building (SBT, Maven)
* documentation (because you always document your projects, right?)
* testing (ScalaTest, Specs, etc.)
* installation (_sbt-assembly_, _sbt-izpack_, _sbt-native-packager_)
* publishing (to Sonatype, to your own public Maven repository)
